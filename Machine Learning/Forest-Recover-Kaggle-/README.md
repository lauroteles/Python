Forest Cover Type Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) using strictly cartographic variables. The data provided for this task is derived from the US Geological Survey and the US Forest Service (USFS) and includes a variety of environmental features. The goal is to accurately classify the forest cover type for given 30 x 30 meter cells using machine learning models.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Jock A. Blackard and Colorado State University, and it is hosted on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of several cartographic variables, including both quantitative and binary columns representing wilderness areas and soil types.

Key Steps and Methods
Data Exploration and Visualization
Loading the Data:

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
Initial exploration of the data includes checking the data types, shape, and for any missing values.
Visualization:

Histograms are plotted for each feature to understand their distributions.
Scatter plots are created to visualize the relationship between each feature and the index.
Box plots are used to identify the distribution and potential outliers in the quantitative features.
Data Preprocessing
Standardization:
The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally.
Model Training and Evaluation
Model Selection:

Several machine learning models are considered, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classifier.
The dataset is split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

For KNN, different values of K are evaluated to find the optimal number of neighbors.
For Random Forest, different random state values are tested to observe their effect on model performance.
Model Evaluation:

The error rates for different configurations of KNN and Random Forest are plotted to visualize their performance.
The final model chosen is a Random Forest Classifier with 90 estimators, which achieves an accuracy of approximately 95.54% on the test set.

Future Work
Further hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
Exploration of additional machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
Incorporation of feature selection techniques to improve model efficiency and performance.
Deployment of the model for real-time forest cover type prediction.
